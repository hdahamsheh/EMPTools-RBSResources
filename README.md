# EMPTools-RBSResources
RBSResources is a simple tool I have created to help me tracking resources accross RBS in MS Project Server.

The tool utilizes Project Server CSOM (Client Side Object Model) and PSI (Project Server Interface), and tested on Microsoft Project Server 2013.

## Usage
- Enter PWA link, username, password, and domain for user with admin permission (or permission allow the user to access admin settings)
- Click "Connect/Disconnect" button to initiate project server context
- Click "Get RBS Tree" to fetch RBS and map resources
- Doule-click on resource to get resource's membership
  - Project Server Groups
  - Sharepoint Groups
